# Library Functionality
This library has the following:
  1. Add vertex (addVertex(v))
  2. Add Undirected Edge (addUndirectedEdge(v, w))
  3. Add Directed Edge (addDirectedEdge(v, w))
  4. Add Weighted Undirected Edge (addWeightedUndirectedEdge(v, w, weight))
  5. Add Weighted Directed Edge (addWeightedDirectedEdge(v, w, weight))
  6. Print Graph (printGraph())
  7. Print Weighted Graph (printWeightedGraph() )
  8. Breadth First Search (BFS(start))
  9. Deapth First Search (DFS(start))
  10. Queue (enqueue(element), dequeue(), length(), isEmpty())
  11. Priority Queue (enqueue(element), dequeue(), isEmpty())
